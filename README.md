# Nyaay Saathi

**Nyaay Saathi** is an AI-powered legal aid platform designed to provide accessible, multilingual support for common legal issues in India. The project combines advanced NLP, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and interactive mapping to empower users with case understanding, risk assessment, document generation, and connections to legal professionals.

## Features

### 1. Case Understanding via AI

- Utilizes DeepSeek R1 to extract case details and classify cases (eviction, wage theft, etc.).
- Robust chatbot interface for interactive case intake.

### 2. Legal Risk Assessment & Advice
- Performs risk prediction using retrieval of similar cases from a Hugging Face legal dataset (`ninadn/indian-legal`), employing cosine similarity for matching.
- Provides step-by-step guidance (evidence collection, deadlines).
- Fetches relevant legal clauses from public databases to enhance advice.

### 3. Document Generation & Templates
- Auto-generates basic legal documents (complaint letters, dispute letters) using user-supplied details.
- Includes pre-built templates for petitions, appeals, and other common legal filings.

### 4. Multilingual Chatbot
- Supports Hindi and English for legal aid via both web and WhatsApp (powered by Twilio).
- Text-to-text interface for accessibilityâ€”no speech features included.

### 5. Lawyer & NGO Directory
